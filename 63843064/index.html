            <h1>
                School History
            </h1>
            <p> Pretoria Central High School is a section 20 government school. The school was built in the fifties as Laerskool
                Paul
                Kruger to cater for the then Afrikaner community of Pilditch in Pretoria West. The school closed down in 1994 after
                a
                huge drop in enrolment.</p>
            
            <p>It was then given to Transoranje school for the deaf who operated on this campus until 2000 when
                they moved all their learners to their main campus on Church street. For 10 years these impressive and durable
                buildings
                were lying in ruins with homeless people illegally occupying the building.</p>
            
            <p>In 2009 the department of Education was faced
                with a serious space shortage for grade 8 learners in inner city secondary schools. Therefore a decision was taken
                to
                resuscitate these majestic buildings and establish a secondary school.</p>
            
            <p>Thus in January 2010 Pretoria Central High School
                was born with 120 grade 8 learners and 8 teachers led by the Acting Principal, Mr. A Wessels.
                On the 1st of November 2010 Mr. Hlongwane was appointed Principal of the school. The school has grown in leaps and
                bounds and in 2011 more than 200 learners applied for grade 8 space at the school, only 160 were admitted. 2012 saw
                the
                introduction of grade 10 class. 
            </p>

            <p>
                To date, the school has produced 7 classes of matriculants from 2014 to 2020 and has over 750 learners that attend.
            </p>

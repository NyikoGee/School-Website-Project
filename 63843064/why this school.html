                <h1>
                    Why I Chose This School
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Pretoria Central High School has been a home to me for my high life and it has been nothing but a pleasure to see and be
                    a part of the school's growth within these past years.It is there where my love for the sciences and technology was
                    developed and groomed thus leading me to the current field in which I am studying namely IT. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    As a product of the school I
                    keep reflecting on the memories of my experience at this school that made my high school life what I would describe as
                    awesome and filled with love and how this was made possible by the staff, the school environment and extra-curricular
                    activities done at the school among many other things. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thus this website allows one either be a student of the school,
                    parent or anyone interested to get a glimpse of what this great school has to offer and is all about; hence my first
                    thought when given this task was about how it would be an honor for me to apply what I love being IT to be of service to
                    my beloved high school Pretoria Central High School.
